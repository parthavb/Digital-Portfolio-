                <h2>PARTHASARATHY</h2>
                <p>"Hi there! My name is Parthasarathy , and I am studing Bsc.,Information technology in Arumugam Pillai Seethai Ammal College located in Tiruppattur, Sivaganga district and I am a dedicated and enthusiastic student pursuing a degree in Information Technology. I have always been fascinated by technology and its potential to positively impact people's lives. As a student, I constantly seek opportunities to broaden my knowledge and skills in this rapidly evolving field. Throughout my academic journey, I have actively engaged in various extracurricular activities related to my interests. I have participated in coding competitions, attended tech conferences, and collaborated with fellow students on innovative projects. These experiences have not only enhanced my technical proficiency but also honed my problem-solving and teamwork abilities.<br><br>
                    My passion for learning extends beyond the classroom. I believe that continuous personal growth and development are critical to excelling in any field. Hence, outside of academics, I am an avid reader and enjoy exploring topics such as artificial intelligence, data science, and software engineering. I am also a strong advocate for promoting diversity and inclusion in tech and am actively involved in student organizations working towards these goals</p>
